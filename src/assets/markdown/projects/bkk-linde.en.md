During my <em>internship semester</em> in <em>September of 2018</em> I began my career path as a Web Developer.
Back then the IT department of the <em>BKK Linde</em> was in the middle of a <em>digital transformation</em>.
The goal was to reduce correspondence and connect to a younger audience by migrating existing core services into the digital landscape.

An externally employed consultant and I formed a <em>tandem</em> to develop a <em>generic form application</em> to determine the insurance status of the insuree.
I was working on the application's integration with third party APIs of service providers like <em>Pimcore</em> and <em>Foxodx</em> as well as the implementation of serverside business logic within the <em><abbr title="Backend as a Service">BaaS</abbr> platform EASY Apiomat</em>.
After the consultant left the project I was responsible for further development and major refactorings from JavaScript to TypeScript.
