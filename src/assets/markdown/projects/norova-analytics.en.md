As a part of the NorOvA project I was hired to implement a web-based analytics tool to investigate spatial data collected by students.
NorOvA Analytics is able to display route records on an interactive map and filter the result by space and time.
The application is used by the research team to conduct analyses and derive suggestions for the VSB (Verkehrsbund Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg) to optimize the public transportation infrastructure.
