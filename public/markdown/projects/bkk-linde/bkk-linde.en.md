My thriving career as a web developer began in <time datetime="2018-09">the late sommer of 2018</time>. <a href="https://www.bkk-linde.de/" target="_blank">BKK Linde's</a> IT department was in midst of their digitalisation efforts. The focal point was to transition some of their physical services to their collection of <a href="https://www.bkk-linde.de/leistungen/serviceapp/" target="_blank">eServices</a> to reduce postage costs. An external consultant and I formed a tandem for that matter. My resposibilities lied in the development of a generic form application to determine the insurance state of our customers. On top of that, I was briefed to connect the app to various APIs of third-party service providers, including <a href="https://pimcore.com/en" target="_blank">Pimcore</a> and <a href="https://www.d-velop.de/software/foxdox" target="_blank">Foxdox</a>, and enter server side business logic into a <abbr title="Backend as a Service">BaaS</abbr> platform called <a href="https://easy-software.com/en/newsroom/apiomat-the-best-of-two-worlds/" target="_blank">EASY Apiomat</a>. After the consultant dropped out of the project, I took full responsibility to further develop the app.
