Contemporaneously to my studies and part-time job as a [working student](/#bkk-linde), I successfully seeked my first project as a freelancer. I was hired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jonas9192" target="\_blank"><em>J&M Angeln</em></a> to build their <a href="https://jmangeln.de/" target="_blank">mobile first website and online shop</a>. With more than 25,000 subscribers, J&M Angeln is one of the fastest-growing, and widely-known fishing channels in Germany. Frequent exchanges and short feedback loops helped to form the product to the client's needs. An integrated video player uses the official <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3" target="_blank">YouTube API</a> to provide direct access to the channel's latest published videos. Product information are stored in a MongoDB database whereas the server is written in JavaScript. The shopping cart and ordering process are build from scratch.
