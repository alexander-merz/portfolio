Alongside my studies and part-time job as a [working student](/#bkk-linde), I sought my first project as a freelancer. I was hired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jonas9192" target="\_blank">J&M Angeln</a> to build their mobile first website and online shop. With more than 25,000 subscribers, J&M Angeln is one of the fastest-growing and widely-known fishing channels in Germany. Frequent exchanges and short feedback loops helped to shape the product to the client's needs. An integrated video player fetches data from the official <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3" target="_blank">YouTube API</a> to provide direct access to the channels latest videos. Product information are stored in a MongoDB database whereas the server is purely written in JavaScript. The shopping cart and ordering process are build from scratch. The website was launched in August 2020 and discontinued in July 2023 due to the channels increasing inactivity.
