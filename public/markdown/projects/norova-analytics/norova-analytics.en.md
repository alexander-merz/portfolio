As a part of my <a href="/pdfs/Thesis_Merz_Alexander.pdf" target="_blank">bachelor thesis</a> I developed an analytics software for the research project <a href="https://vm.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/politik-zukunft/zukunftskonzepte/digitale-mobilitaet/mobiarch-bw/norova/" target="_blank"><abbr title="Nutzerorientierte Optimierung verkehrlicher Angebote">NorOvA</abbr></a>.
The project is a collaboration between the <a href="https://www.v-s-b.de/" target="_blank"><abbr title="Verkehrsverbund Schwarzwald-Baar">VSB</abbr></a> an the <a href="https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/en/" target="_blank">Hochschule Furtwangen</a>. It aims to evaluate student's mobility patterns in rural areas to derive lasting optimization measures for public transportation. Students were able to track their way to and from their university by means of a mobile app provided by the research team. Upon my arrival, the team faced the challenge to utilise their rapidly growing database for effective data analyses. Within the next six month, I indepen&shy;dently worked on a Full Stack solution, tying together complex SQL queries and a web-based visualization of geographic information. <em>NorOvA Analytics</em> is capable to depict routes on an inter&shy;active map, powered by <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a>, and convey detailed information thanks to a sortable table. Moreover, analysts can delimit their results spatially by drawing vectors on the map (<a href="public/images/norova-analytics.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>).
