After my contract with Continental has ended, I was eagerly looking for a bigger role within an up-and-coming software house.
Being able to work 100% remotely, contribute to a vast codebase, speak English in an international product team and learn from many talented developers were all factors why I chose StudySmarter.
I am a proud member of <em>StudyStarters</em>: a product team dedicated to the conversion and (re-)activation of new users.
My working areas include Authentication, Onboarding and Tutorials within our Angular web app and <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic</a> mobile app.
My biggest contributions were, without a doubt, my assistance on a complete re-write of our Onboarding and the design of an effective architecture for contextual tutorials.
With the intention of moving to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo" target="_blank">monorepo</a>, both features were extracted into a shared library used on both platforms.
