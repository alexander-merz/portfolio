After working as a Consultant, I was eager to join a wide and diverse team of developers in an up-and-coming software company.
Being part of a scale-up company, work 100% remotely, contribute to a vast codebase and speak English in an international product team were all factors why I chose StudySmarter.
As a member of the Growth team, I am constantly working on conversion and (re-)activation of new users, alongside my 3 to 4 Frontend peers.
Working areas include Authentication, Onboarding, Contextual Tutorials and a Notification-based Study Plan within our Angular web app and <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic</a> mobile app.
My biggest contributions were my assistance on a complete re-write of our Onboarding and the architectural design for Contextual Tutorials.
With the intention of moving to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo" target="_blank">monorepo</a>, both features were extracted into a shared library used on both platforms.
