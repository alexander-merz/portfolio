After my contract with Continental has ended, I was eagerly looking for a bigger role within an up-and-coming software house.
Being able to work 100% remotely, contribute to a vast codebase, speak English in an international product team and learn from many talented developers were all factors why I chose StudySmarter.

My working areas include Authentication, Onboarding and Tutorials within our Angular web app and <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic</a> mobile app.
My biggest contribution was, without a doubt, my assistance on a complete re-write of our Onboarding.
