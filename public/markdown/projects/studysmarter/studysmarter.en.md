After gaining experience as a Consultant, I sought the opportunity to join a diverse team of developers at a promising scale-up software company.
I learned a lot contributing to a substantial codebase and collaborating in a multinational cross-functional product team.
As a member of the Growth team, focused on user conversion and reactivation, I work closely with Product Management, Designers, Quality Assurance and my fellow three to four developing peers.
I have been instrumental in developing and maintaining features like Referrals, Authentication, Onboarding, tutorials and a notification-based study plan.
Lately, I joined forces with our Wordpress Developers to provide a seemless sign-up process to our millions of monthly website visitors.
