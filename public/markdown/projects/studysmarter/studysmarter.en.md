After gaining experience as a Consultant, I sought the opportunity to join a diverse team of developers at a promising software company.
Motivated by the prospect of working in a thriving scale-up environment and relishing the flexibility of remote work, I was enticed by StudySmarter.
The opportunity to contribute to a substantial codebase and to collaborate in an international product team solidified my choice.
As a member of the Growth team, focused on user conversion and reactivation, I work closely with Product Management, Designers, Quality Assurance and my fellow 3 to 4 developing peers.
I have been instrumental in developing and maintaining features like Authentication, Onboarding, Contextual Tutorials and a notification-based study plan.
Lately, our Website Engineers and I were working on a seemless sign-up and conversion experience for our numerous website visitors.
