After working independently for the majority of my career, I was aspired to join a wide and diverse team of developers in an up-and-coming software house.
Being part of a scale-up company, work 100% remotely, contribute to a vast codebase, speak English in an international product team and learn from many talented developers were all factors why I chose StudySmarter.
I am a proud member of <em>StudyStarters</em>: a product team dedicated to the conversion and (re-)activation of new users.
Together with 3 to 4 FE peers, I was continuously working on Authentication, Onboarding, Contextual Tutorials and a Notification-based Study Plan within our Angular web app and <a href="https://ionicframework.com/" target="_blank">Ionic</a> mobile app.
My biggest contributions were my assistance on a complete re-write of our Onboarding and the architectural design for Contextual Tutorials.
With the intention of moving to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo" target="_blank">monorepo</a>, both features were extracted into a shared library used on both platforms.
