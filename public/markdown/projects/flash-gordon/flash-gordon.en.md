My very first acquisition talk as a Consultant was a success: I landed a project agreement with <a href="https://www.continental.com/en/" target="_blank">Continental</a> in Frankfurt. By the end of 2020, I joined the development team of three people through the <a href="https://www.webergmbh.de/EN_index_1000.html" target="_blank">Weber GmbH</a>. The project's goal was to industrialise the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#Flashing" target="_blank">flash process</a> of Anti-lock braking systems. In other words: bringing the "Flashing" of electronic control units to the production line. As the team's only Frontend Developer, I was faced with a Greenfield project. The <em>Flash Line View</em> is meant for the production workers to monitor and steer the Flash process in realtime. The central pillar of the app is a bidirectional communi&shy;cation via <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/signalr" target="_blank">SignalR</a> web sockets. <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly" target="_blank">Blockly</a> was integrated and extended with <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/configure/web/custom-blocks" target="_blank">custom blocks</a> to enable workers to author flash process scripts.
