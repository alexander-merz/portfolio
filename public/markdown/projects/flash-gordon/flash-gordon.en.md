My very first acqusition talk as a Consultant was a huge success: I landed a project agreement with <a href="https://www.continental.com/en/" target="_blank">Continental</a> in Frankfurt. By the end of 2020, I was introduced to the development team of three people through the <a href="https://www.webergmbh.de/EN_index_1000.html" target="_blank">Weber GmbH</a>. The project's goal was to indulstrialize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware#Flashing" target="_blank">flash processes</a> of <abbr title="Anti-lock braking system">ABS</abbr>. In other words: bringing the "Flashing" of <abbr title="Electronic control unit">ECUs</abbr> to the production line. As the team's only Frontend Developer, I was in charge to create an Angular application from scratch. The <em>Flash Line View</em> is meant for the production workers to monitor and steer the Flash process in realtime. The central pillars of the app are a bidirectional communication via <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/signalr" target="_blank">SignalR</a> web sockets and a reactive programming paradigm in the Frontend. To enable workers to author flash process scripts, <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly" target="_blank">Blockly</a> was integrated and extended with <a href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/configure/web/custom-blocks" target="_blank">cutom blocks</a>.
